kaccessible implements a QAccessibleBridgePlugin to provide accessibility services like focus tracking.

Components;
* kaccessibleapp is a dbus activation service that acts as proxy.
* kaccessiblebridge will be loaded by the QAccessible framework into each Qt-/KDE-application.

Usage;
You need to call "export QT_ACCESSIBILITY=1" before you start the application that should be made
accessible. Per default this is disabled cause QAccessible can slow down things.

Used in;
* KMag's "Follow Focus" Mode.
* soon; KWin zoom and magnifier plugins.

Todo;
* Implement QAccessibleInterface's if needed for;
  * Konqueror, Dolphin, KHtml, WebKit
  * KWrite's KateInternal text-canvas
  * Plasma desktop, panel and kickoff
* Look how to better integrate Gtk-apps (qtatspi)
