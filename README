kaccessible implements a QAccessibleBridgePlugin to provide accessibility services like
focus tracking and a screenreader.

Components;
* kaccessibleapp is a dbus activation service that acts as proxy.
* kaccessiblebridge will be loaded by the QAccessible framework into each Qt-/KDE-application.

Usage;
You need to call "export QT_ACCESSIBILITY=1" before you start the application that should be made
accessible. Per default this is disabled cause QAccessible can slow down things.

Used in;
* KMag's "Follow Focus" Mode. Start KMagnifier and press F2 to switch to that mode.
* KWin's Zoom Plugin. Enable the "Follow Focus" mode in the effect settings.
* Screenreader. Enable the screenreader via "qdbus org.kde.kaccessibleapp /Adaptor setSpeechEnabled true"

Todo;
* Implement QAccessibleInterface's if needed for;
  * Konqueror, Dolphin, KHtml, WebKit
  * Plasma desktop, panel and kickoff
* Look how to better integrate Gtk-apps (qtatspi)
* Integrate Jovie/opentts/Orca
* key-echo
* better cursor markers like CrossHair or RedFrame
* brail, profiles, ...
